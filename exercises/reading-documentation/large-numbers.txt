In Ruby, an underscore may be used in a number to make it easier to read. You may use underscores in both Integer and Float numbers. 

For example: 
987654 == 987_654

Further Exploration:
Yes, the number 1_987_654_321 may also be written as 19_87_65_4321. This is the same number to Ruby. Where you place underscores depends on the information you want to convey with the number.
