# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 2)

def meal
  'Evening'
end

puts meal   # will print 'Evening'. The string 'Evening' is the only line to evaluate in the method, so it is the return value for the method.

# The #puts call will print the evaluated result (return result) of the meal method, which is the string 'Breakfast'.

# This is similar to the last exercise, except the meal method is using implict return rather than explicit return.
